- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrMadPPT

I am a team player, thoughtful young leader, that values collaboration and flat hierarchies, leads by doing and fights for
inclusiveness. Everyone has something to bring to the table, it is a matter of creating the environment where people can
comfortably share, by facilitating cross-fertilization of thoughts, empathizing, and knowing that sometimes there isn’t a
right or wrong only a difference of perspectives.

As I see and experience the world, I always wonder how things are made and how they work - focusing in
understanding the how and the what to therefore grasp the true nature of things. I flourish when I am involved in
creating new solutions both at work and in my private life, seeking to be impactful on what I do, my first startup wanted
to reduce the number of car accidents through AI solutions, I created new IT Strategies while in working in consultancy Italy to
renovate the outdated Financial Services Sector and I joined the Oil Industry to progress the net-zero carbon agenda and
sustainability objectives.

I am a fast learner, doer, and jack-of-all trades, I believe the world is shaped by resilient people that believed in
themselves enough… so why shouldn’t I be able to do anything if I put my mind into it? Some things I learned from zero
during my life: learned photography and how to develop black and white film (best junior photographer for National
Geographic in Italy in 2010), created my own ecommerce website when I was 19, setup my house electrical system at 21
years old (saved 5k$ on electricians), became a skillful 3D designer and interior designer for my own furniture and
house appliances, learned and mastered PowerBi, developed and released my automatic trading crypto bot…
